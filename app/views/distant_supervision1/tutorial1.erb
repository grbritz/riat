				<h1>Your Task</h1>
				<p>You are going to help train our system so that it can understand which <strong><em>facts</em></strong> are expressed in English sentences. We are going to present you with a series of sentences and a list of facts that we think might be in that sentence. Your job is to do two things:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Annotate if the facts are expressed by the sentence.</li>
					<li>Determine if we used a good pattern to find each fact.</li>
				</ol>
				<h2>What to Look For</h2>
				<h4>Are the facts present?</h4>
				<p>Consider the following sentence:</p>

				<blockquote><span class="entity">Bill Clinton</span>, former <span class="entity">U.S.</span> President, spoke at a conference on national debt last week.</blockquote>
				<p>I've marked the two entities we care about in this text. In this case, we want to know if the fact <span class="relation">Bill Clinton <em>has nationality</em> U.S.</span> is expressed. Since the sentence says that Bill Clinton was a former U.S. president, we can infer that he must have the nationality of United States. So we would say that this sentence expresses this fact. </p>

				<h4>Is the Pattern Good?</h4>
				<p>While our system is learning, it makes patterns based upon the structure of the sentences it looks at. It uses those patterns to try to find more facts. Your annotations will help our system learn which patterns are good, and which are bad. Consider this sentence:</p>
				<blockquote>Zambian President <span class="entity">Levy Mwanawasa</span> has admitted the challenge <span class="entity">Zambia</span> faces in choosing between the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) , according Sunday Mail.</blockquote>
				<p>Following the above logic, the relation <span class="relation">Levy Mwanawasa <em>has nationality</em> Zambia</span> is true, but is our system using a good pattern figure that out? Our system thinks that the second mention of Zambia is the one that it should use to make a pattern. If we removed "Zambian President" from the beginning of this sentence, would you still know that Levy Mwanawasa was Zambian only from reading this sentence? No.</p>
				<p>In this circumstance, we would say that the fact is expressed, but the pattern is bad. </p>
